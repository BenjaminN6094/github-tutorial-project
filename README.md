# _Benjamin Novik's Github Tutorial Project_
---
Hello! This file is meant for people who are new or trying to review Git and Github. I have been using Github since September 2019 for a couple months. I believe that I have a great enough understanding to try and teach others. If you used Git and Github before you might just learn a new trick or two.
