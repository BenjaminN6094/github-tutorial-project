# _Benjamin Novik's Github Tutorial Project_
---
Hello! This file is meant for people who are new or trying to review Git and Github. I have been using Github since September 2019 for a couple months. I believe that I have a great enough understanding to try and teach others. If you used Git and Github before you might just learn a new trick or two.  

### Git VS Github
___
Git and Github are two seperate things but you need Github to use Git. You do not need Git to use Github.  

_What is Github?_ Github is a cloudbased tool or service used to help creators share, store and collaborate with each other. It is popular for its ability to track changes made to a file. The 'creators' or the user is able to upload their project(s) to be saved onto the Github server. If you are doing a group project with other people, Github will allow you to share it so that other people can edit and make changes to the file.  

_What is Git_? Git is designed to work hand and hand with Github. It is installed into your local or your computer system. Your local is like your hard drive. Its where all of your files, directories, downloads, images etc are located. You would use the command line to navigate through your files and projects efficiently. When Git is activated within your directories they become repositories. You can then begin to use Git to track your changes to then upload them to Github for a safe place to save your files and projects.
